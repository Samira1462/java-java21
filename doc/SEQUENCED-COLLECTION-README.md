# Record Patterns in Java 21

## Overview
Java 21 introduced a powerful feature called Record Patterns as part of enhancing pattern matching capabilities in Java. Record Patterns allow for pattern matching on records, which are a special kind of class in Java designed to hold immutable data. This feature enables concise and readable code, especially when deconstructing complex objects.

Before diving into Record Patterns, it's important to understand what records are. Records were introduced in Java 14 (as a preview feature) and became a standard feature in Java 16. A record is a special class that is designed to be a simple, immutable data carrier.
### Prerequisites

- **Java 21**


### Benefits of Record Patterns
- Conciseness: Eliminates boilerplate code by allowing direct deconstruction of records.
- Readability: Makes the code easier to read and understand.
- Type Safety: Ensures that the patterns are checked at compile time.

### Limitations
- Complexity: While powerful, deeply nested patterns can become complex and harder to maintain.
- Performance Considerations: Deconstruction might have a small impact on performance, though this is usually negligible.
